As part of an assignment for my reinforcement learning course I implemented a Tic Tac Toe game. The AI is trained by playing against itself 40,000+ times. After being trained it can play against a human player. The AI can play both as first and second player.

After being trained the AI will not make any mistakes, and there will be no way of beating it
